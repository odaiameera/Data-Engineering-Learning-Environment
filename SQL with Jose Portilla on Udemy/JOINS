-- As Statement 
SELECT COUNT (*) AS number_tranx
FROM payment

SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM payment 
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM (amount) > 100;

-- Joins Basic Syntax 
SELECT * FROM tableA
INNER JOIN TableB
ON TableA.com_match = TableB.col_match 

SELECT * FROM registrations 
INNER JOIN Logins
ON registrations.name = Logins.name 

/* This is basically saying grab the registrations table and also grab the logins table and join them together on the column
that matches in both tables which is the name column */ 

-- Example from my database which is not in the course 

SELECT *
FROM address
INNER JOIN customer 
ON address.address_id = customer.address_id;

SELECT * FROM payment
INNER JOIN customer 
ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id;

SELECT payment_id,payment.customer_id,customer.first_name 
FROM payment 
INNER JOIN customer 
ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id;

/* 💡 SQL INNER JOIN Cheatsheet: 
• The Intersection Rule: Only returns rows where there is a match in both tables. No match = No row.
• NULLs are Invisible: `NULL` values never match anything (even other `NULL`s). They are automatically excluded.
• Default Behavior: `JOIN` is shorthand for `INNER JOIN` in almost all SQL dialects.
• The "Explosion" Risk: If you join on a non-unique column, one row can match many others, creating unexpected duplicates.
• Aliases are Mandatory: Use `table AS t` to avoid "ambiguous column name" errors and keep code readable.
• Filter First?: Remember that `INNER JOIN` is a filter. If you're missing data you expected to see, switch to a `LEFT JOIN` to troubleshoot. */
